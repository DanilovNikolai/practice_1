# **Web Application with Counter, Fetch API and Posts-list**

This is a project where I practiced learning the React library.

# **App description:**

The application consists of several pages and has routing.
Switching between pages is done by navbar.

## **Login**

The login here is formal, it does not matter what you enter in the input fields.
After logging in, you get to the home page and the rest of the pages are available to you.

## **Counter**

This is a regular counter with the function of decreasing, increasing and clearing.
When the number "10" or "-10" is reached, a modal window appears.

## **Fetch API**

On this page, we get various data (list of users, todos and posts) using a fetch request to **_jsonplaceholder.typicode.com._**

## **Posts-list**

This page contains a list of posts from the **_jsonplaceholder.typicode.com._**
The list can be sorted by name or description. There is a search input.
Dynamic scrolling works when scrolling down. You can choose how many posts to upload when scrolling.
You can create your own post with a title and description (the form appears in the modal window).
You can delete each post, as well as view a list of comments that are also taken from **_jsonplaceholder.typicode.com._**
